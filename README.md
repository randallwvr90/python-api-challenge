## Background
Using Python requests, API's and JSON transversals to answer the question" "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
* WeatherPy
  * WeatherPy.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that will visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Uses the python library citypy and the OpenWeatherMap API. 
  * The WeatherPy notebook will be used to create scatter plots that display the following relationships:
    * Temperature vs. Latitude
    * Humidity vs. Latitude
    * Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    * Wind Speed vs. Latitude
  * A linear regression will be run on each of these relationships. Each of the above relationships will be displayed along with a linear regression on a pair of plots: one for the Northern Hemisphere and one for the Southern Hemisphere. 
  * The analysis and data will be saved in a CSV file and PNG images of each scatter plot. These will be saved in the output_data directory. 
* VacationPy
